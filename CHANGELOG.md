# Changelog

## 0.3.0

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Breaking change**: Completely redesigned API

Introducing an all-new API that is both simpler to use and much more flexible. See [docs](https://mharrisb1.github.io/openai-responses-python) for more.

In addition to a new API, this release closed these issues:

- [#1: feat: ability to raise exceptions](https://github.com/mharrisb1/openai-responses-python/issues/1)
- [#9: feat: base url override](https://github.com/mharrisb1/openai-responses-python/issues/9)
- [#28: feat: automatically share state between chained mocks](https://github.com/mharrisb1/openai-responses-python/issues/28)

Additional notes:

- Removes token estimation. This is now the responsibility of the user to provided mock token count
- Adds more example files
- Still not completely happy with current state of mocking run steps. Will likely change in the near future.
