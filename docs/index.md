# Introduction

Pytest plugin for automatically mocking OpenAI requests. See the [user guide](user_guide/index.md) to get started.

!!! note

    This project does not try to generate fake responses from the models. Any part of a response that would be generated by a model will need to
    be defined by the user or will fallback to a default value.
